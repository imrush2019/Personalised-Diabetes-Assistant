# Personalised-Diabetes-care-Assistant
# Tagline
A smart app for persons with type II diabetes to manage their blood glucose levels by providing personalized recommendations on exercise using reinforcement learning. 
# Summary Paragraph
The management of type II diabetes is multimodal. The interplay between diet, blood sugar-lowering medications and exercise dictate the changes in the blood glucose levels. For a given diet, a balance between adequate exercise and medications can effectively maintain blood glucose within a normal range. By using reinforcement learning, our application learns a person’s response to medications and exercise overtime.  The app helps minimize the person’s dependance on medications for maintaining optimal blood glucose levels by providing personalized recommendations on exercise type, duration and intensity. 
# Solution
We identify persons at increased risk for type II diabetes using a standard questionnaire. From those persons at increased risk or with diabetes, additional information on their blood glucose, exercise, sleep, insulin use etc is obtained. These are evidence based factors that play a role in the changes in blood glucose levels.

To begin with, the user receives standard evidence based recommendations on exercise: 150 mins/week of moderate intensity exercise. As the user continues to use the application, his/her information is used to train a reinforcement learning based model to predict the best combination of insulin and exercise needed to maintain blood glucose within a normal range. By providing recommendations on exercise levels, the app aims to minimize insulin use and motivate people to use exercise more effectively in the management of their blood glucose.
